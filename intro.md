# Introduction

This document defines the "samenhangend model" (SAM): an overarching information model describing the coherence, i.e. the relationships between object types from heterogeneous data sources which are published together in a single orchestrated dataset. 

The data sources are 
- Addresses and buildings (BAG) 
- Large scale topography (BGT)
- Small scale topography (BRT)
- Cadastral registry: only the Cadastral Map (BRK, only DKK)
- Underground infrastructure networks (IMKL)
- Spatial plans (IMRO)
- Administrative boundaries (DisGeo Bestuurlijke gebieden)
- Underground: geology + soil (BRO)
